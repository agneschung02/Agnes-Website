        <div class="subheading mb-5">PsychologyðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">	My name is Agnes Chung, and I am 21 years old. I was born and raised in Southern California, currently an undergraduate student at the University of California, Riverside in the College of Humanities, Arts, and Sciences. I am into my third year as a psychology major, currently studying computer science as well, working towards a minor in computer science. 
With a degree in psychology minoring in computer science, I look towards the future with an open mind, with a wide choice of career paths. I yearn to find a field of work in which satisfies my passion toward both psychology and computer science. I am a fast learner, and especially good at working ardently in a detail oriented fashion. Growing up in America with South Korean parents, I am multilingual in English and Korean, more specifically, fluent in English and intermediate in Korean. I also possess excellent time management and manner, keeping a good, well-maintained balance between my personal life and professional life. 
<br><br>

        As for my previous jobs, I have worked at Paris Baguette, Elite Prep, and possess multiple state and presidential awards for volunteer and community work. At Paris Baguette, I worked part time in the food industry, providing friendly, fast, efficient, and accommodating service to all customers. I also learned how to work through rush hours, all while maintaining a respectful attitude to customers and coworkers. At Elite Prep, I was in charge of regulating tutor service and distributing schedules to tutors and students. I was required to contact parents, students, and tutors regarding their required tutor material, as well as maintaining the cleanliness of the building. I respectfully worked towards a well-maintained environment for the students in which they were able to feel comfortable and motivated. Towards serving my community, I have volunteered in many institutions and programs within Orange County. From middle school to the end of high school, I have volunteered in programs, the two main ones being Young Leaders of Orange County, G.I.V.E, and the Boys and Girls Club of America. I helped tutor students and children that were less fortunate, offering them free supplemental education regarding mathematics, english, piano theory, and science. I was fortunate enough to serve a minimum amount of hours to earn the awards of Presidentâ€™s Volunteer Service AwardÂ 2016, Presidentâ€™s Volunteer Service Award 2018, California State Assembly Award of Recognition 2016, and California County of Orange Award of Leadership Recognition and Appreciation 2019. 
e<br><br>

        I strongly believe that all of the activities, jobs, studies, and community work that I have participated in has definitely helped to shape me into the person I am today. Being an active member and part of these experiences have influenced me to make so many connections and interactions that have humbled me greatly. Having work experience both in the food industry, and office work, I have learned excellent written and communication skills.  These experiences have taught me, not only about my community and people around me, but also about myself.
